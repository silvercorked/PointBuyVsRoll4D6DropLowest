# Point Buy vs Roll 4d6, drop the lowest
 - So point buy gives an expected value of 12.5 overall for your stat values combined. This is actually exactly so every time, as point buy doesn't have random elements. Rolling is the other option, and the common convetion I've seen for rolling is to roll 4 6 sided dice, and add together the highest three results and that is your stat. This shows the 4d6 drop lowest method, to produce an expected value of 12.245, slightly lower than point buy's constant amount.
 - Though point buy wins in expected value, the rules of point buy make rolling the only way to achieve many interesting scenarios with character creation. It also forces a player to always have decent stats as you must use all the points. For this reason, despite the lesser overall sum of stats, I roll.
